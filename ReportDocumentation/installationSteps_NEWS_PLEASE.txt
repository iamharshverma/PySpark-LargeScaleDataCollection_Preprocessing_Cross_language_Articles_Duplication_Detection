Installation using command prompt
$ pip3 install news-please 

Crawling
1. Go to command prompt and type news-please
2. For the first crawl it will ask you whether you want a news-please repository to be created. Give permission to create a new repository.
3. The results and scripts will be stored in this repository.
4. In the data folder the html and json files will be created.
5. sitelist.hjson file is the file where you need to specify the url's to be crawled.
I have provided a sample sitelist.hjson file and another file which specifies the urls which can be crawled.
